Description: Computational tool box for radiogenomic analysis which integrates
    radioresponse data, radiobiological modelling and comprehensive cell line
    annotations for hundreds of cancer cell lines. The RadioSet class enables
    creation and manipulation of standardized datasets including information
    about cancer cells lines, radioresponse assays and dose-response indicators. 
    Included methods allow fitting and plotting dose-response data using 
    established radiobiological models along with quality control to validate
    results. Additional functions related to fitting and plotting dose response 
    curves, quantifying statistical correlation and calculating AUC or SF are 
    included. For more details please see the included documentation, as well 
    as: Vankata, M. et al. (2018) <doi:10.1101/449793>, Smirnov, P. et al.
